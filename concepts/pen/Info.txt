The pen functionality automation is the simulation of a pen action on a web page.
While it may not be a common use case, there are situations where simulating pen
actions could be relevant. For instance, in the context of testing applications
that support pen input or stylus-based devices, simulating pen actions can be
important to ensure the functionality and responsiveness of the application.

Furthermore, as web applications continue to evolve and support a wide range of
input devices, testing the behavior of these applications with different types
of inputs, including pen or stylus, becomes crucial for ensuring a seamless user
experience across various devices. Therefore, while not the most common scenario,
simulating pen actions can be useful in specific testing contexts.
